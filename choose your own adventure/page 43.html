                 -As you get deeper into the Ikea you get lost. you wander the entire night trying to find an exit having long forgotten what you were even doing there. Hours turn into days and days turn into months but you still haven't found a way out. You lose hope. The only thing you have eaten are the occasional cold meatballs that were left there by some unknown people.
