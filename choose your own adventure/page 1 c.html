                 -As you finally arrive to the mall and step inside, you feel the warm inside air gently breeze over your hair. While walking across the varying store an odd promotion catches your eye. A 19 dollar Fortnite gift card giveaway? Who would want such an odd commodity. But ay atleast it will make the winners day a little bit better. <br>
                 You quickly brush it off and redirect your focus. We have to find a plase where we can rest and continue planning.
