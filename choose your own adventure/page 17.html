                 -As you wait in the dark and cold for hours you suddenly feel hot and start taking off clothes. The world start spinning as you try to comprehend what's going on. In the morning the first thing that the workers see is a frozen dead body. The media doesn't have any clue how somebody could've gotten there and died and it will remain a mystery as your friends didn't tell anybody about this fearing that they will get in trouble.
